\chapter*{Abstract}
Learning about software modeling languages from documentation can be a difficult and confusing process, and many of the currently existing ``modeling language tutorials'' are only marginally better. At the same time, players of video games spend hours upon hours learning complex concepts with great success, which in turn is supporting the emerging trend of educational games. This thesis presents a combination of the two approaches, where software modeling languages are taught in an environment that utilizes learning principles and strategies from games.

\noindent
Focusing on modeling with \gls{uml} activities in the context of Reactive Blocks, two different approaches are presented. The first approach is simply an ``enhanced'' tutorial, utilizing principles such as \emph{interactiveness} and \emph{context-sensitivity of information} to engage learners. The second approach is an educational game, adding \emph{immersion} and \emph{visualization} to the learning experience.

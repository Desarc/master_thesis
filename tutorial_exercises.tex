\chapter{A Set of Tutorial Exercises}
\label{ch:tutorial_exercises}
As the first part of my own work, I set out to create a set of tutorial exercises for learning to use \gls{uml} Activities and Reactive Blocks. This chapter begins by describing the motivation behind and goals for this set of exercises. A tutorial design is then proposed, followed by a description of and results from a user study.
